- Firestore Database enabled
- Security rules configured

#### 4. Build APK

**Release APK (Recommended):**
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

**Debug APK:**
```bash
flutter build apk --debug
```

**Split APKs by Architecture (Smaller size):**
```bash
flutter build apk --split-per-abi --release
```

Build output location:
- `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`
- `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk`
- `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-arm64-v8a-release.apk`
- `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-x86_64-release.apk`

#### 6. Run on Device/Emulator

**Android:**
```bash
flutter run -d android
```

**iOS:**
```bash
flutter run -d ios
```

**List available devices:**

## Release Checklist

Before releasing new version:

- [ ] Update version in `pubspec.yaml`
- [ ] Update `versionCode` and `versionName` in `android/app/build.gradle`
- [ ] Test on physical devices (Android/iOS)
- [ ] Build release APK: `flutter build apk --release`
- [ ] Test release APK on device
- [ ] Create signed APK with release keystore
- [ ] Upload to repository with version tag

## Performance Optimization

**Reduce APK Size:**
```bash
flutter build apk --split-per-abi --release
```

**Analyze APK Size:**
```bash
flutter build apk --analyze-size
```

**Enable Obfuscation:**
```bash
flutter build apk --obfuscate --split-debug-info=/<project>/debug-info
```
